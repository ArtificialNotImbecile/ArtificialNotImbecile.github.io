Explain things

# The plan
I try to learn things using jupyter under notes/ folder. when I feel ready to put it into a post, then I convert the corresponding notebook into markdown file under _post/ folder. And of course, the notebook is no longer needed and is safe to remove

# TODO
fix date can't be today, maybe related to timezone like this [issue](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/7516)
